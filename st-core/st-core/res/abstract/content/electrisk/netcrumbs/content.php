        <p> Home automation or domotics is building automation for a home, called a smart home. A home automation system will control lighting, climate, entertainment systems and appliances. It may also include home security such as
            access control and alarm systems. When connected with the Internet, home devices are an important constituent of the Internet of things.</p>
        <p>A home automation system typically connects controlled devices to a central hub or “gateway”. The user interface for control of the system uses either wall-mounted terminals, table or desktop computers, a mobile phone
            application, or a web interface, that may also be accessible off-site through the Internet.
